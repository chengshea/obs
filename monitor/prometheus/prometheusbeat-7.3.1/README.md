## Getting Started

To get started with Prometheusbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Prometheusbeat with:

     ./prometheusbeat -c prometheusbeat.yml -e

This will start Prometheusbeat and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Prometheusbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./prometheusbeat setup -e
